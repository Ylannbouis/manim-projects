# manim-projects

https://www.manim.community/
This is an overview of my Manim projects (A math animation Python library).
I coded these a while ago, while I committed them to github only recently. 
Note that while the repository says that most of the code is in Tex, the Tex was made automatically by the library (when I run the code) and not by me. 
The code I wrote is found in the .py files in each folder.
