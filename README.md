# manim-projects

This is an overview of my Manim projects (A math animation Python library created by 3Blue1Brown and his community).
I coded these a while ago, while I pushed them to github only recently.
Note that while the repository says that most of the code is in Tex, the Tex was made automatically by the library (when I run the code) and not by me. 
The code I wrote is found in the .py files in each folder.

The Manim (Community edition) website can be found here: https://www.manim.community/. 
My code is written using the Community Edition, not the exact edition 3Blue1Brown uses.
